The Weather App is a web application built using Express and Node.js that allows users to retrieve real-time weather information for any desired city. By leveraging the OpenWeather API, this application delivers accurate and up-to-date weather data to users with just a few clicks.

The user-friendly interface prompts users to input the name of a city. Once submitted, the application establishes a connection to the OpenWeather API and retrieves the relevant weather information for the specified location. The retrieved data includes essential details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and more. This enables users to stay informed about the current weather conditions in their desired city.
